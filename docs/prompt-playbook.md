# MyForge Prompt Playbook

A step-by-step command and prompt reference for anyone bootstrapping a new project with MyForge. Copy-paste each command or prompt in sequence.

---

## Prerequisites

- An agent harness - **GitHub Copilot** in VS Code or [Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-cli), **Claude Code**, or any runtime that detects agents and skills from a repo directory
- This repository cloned locally
- A target project directory created and initialized as a git repo

```bash
mkdir ~/Projects/my-new-project
cd ~/Projects/my-new-project
git init
```

---

## Step 1 - Bootstrap MyForge into Your Project

If you prefer a browser-based workflow for creating, opening, and monitoring projects after bootstrap, see the [Forge Console user guide](forge-console-user-guide.md).

To use MyForge with an application that already exists, open the Console and
choose **Bootstrap an existing repo**, or run:

```bash
forge-launcher bootstrap ~/Projects/existing-app --harness opencode
```

The directory must already be a Git repository. For a non-Git directory, use
`--init-git` explicitly; non-interactive workflows must also provide that flag.
Bootstrap does not overwrite existing Forge files unless `--force` is supplied.

Copy the agent and skill templates into your project's harness directory with the launcher (Node, cross-platform):

```bash
forge-launcher bootstrap ~/Projects/my-new-project           # default → .agents/
forge-launcher bootstrap ~/Projects/my-new-project --harness github   # GitHub Copilot → .github/
forge-launcher bootstrap ~/Projects/my-new-project --harness claude   # Claude Code → .claude/
forge-launcher bootstrap ~/Projects/my-new-project --harness opencode # opencode → .opencode/
forge-launcher bootstrap ~/Projects/my-new-project --force   # force overwrite when re-bootstrapping
```

After bootstrapping, commit the templates so your harness can detect them:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/my-new-project
git add .agents/
git commit -m "chore: bootstrap MyForge agent and skill templates"
```

> Open your target project before running the prompts below - your agent harness auto-detects agents and skills from `.agents/agents/` and `.agents/skills/` (or `.github/` / `.claude/` if bootstrapped with the matching `--harness` flag).
>
> The prompts below use `@workspace` syntax. If your harness uses different syntax for invoking agents and skills, adapt accordingly (e.g., `/forge-build-prd ...` directly in Copilot CLI).

---

## Fast Path - Build a Reviewed PRD in One Prompt (Optional)

To go from a one-line idea to reviewed requirements, use `forge-auto-build-prd`.
It confirms the idea and invokes `forge-build-prd` to author PRD and
features directly, including one-feature solutions. It stops before team generation.

```
@workspace /forge-auto-build-prd I want to build [describe your idea in one sentence].
```

`forge-build-prd` presents its PRD review checklist before the document is saved. Reply `revise: <notes>` to iterate on the PRD, or approve to finish. Once `docs/PRD.md` exists (plus `docs/PRD.md` + `docs/features/*.md` when decomposed), generate the team and build - `forge-launcher resume` from the terminal, or in the harness `/forge-build-agent-team` then `@project-orchestrator` / `@workflow-orchestrator`.

If you prefer to drive the PRD yourself, use `forge-build-prd` directly (Step 2 below).

---

## Full Auto Build - Terminal Fast-Path (Requires an Existing PRD)

`forge-auto-build` is the **terminal/headless execution fast-path**: it takes an existing, reviewed PRD and runs the entire build pipeline with no manual hand-offs. It does **not** generate a PRD - that is a deliberate, separate stage. It is driven by `forge-launcher` (`--headless`, or the auto-draft flow) rather than invoked as an in-harness slash command - inside a chat harness use `@project-orchestrator` (interactive) or `@workflow-orchestrator` (autonomous) instead.

`forge-build-agent-team` → `forge-build-project-skills` → `forge-execution-adapter` → `forge-orchestrate-build` **(each stage has its own review boundary)**

```
# Terminal / headless (recommended entry):
forge-launcher --headless
opencode run --auto "/forge-auto-build Use docs/PRD.md as the project PRD. GO"
```

> If no PRD exists yet, `forge-auto-build` stops at its pre-flight check and directs you to `forge-auto-build-prd` or `forge-build-prd` first. It will not interview you for a one-line idea.

**How it works:**

1. Its pre-flight validates `docs/PRD.md` + `docs/features/*.md`, then presents a single approval gate. Review the plan and type `GO` to launch.
2. After `GO`, the flow advances through three separate authoring stages - PRD, team, and project skills - before manifest compilation and execution. A failed skills stage must be reported and retried explicitly; it is not silently treated as "no skills required".
   The team-to-skills candidate handoff is required and immutable; an empty or
   all-`omit` candidate set is the explicit successful no-skills result.
3. After every build phase completes, validation checks run (build, lint, tests) and a commit is made automatically.
4. If any validation fails, the run stops and reports the exact error -it does not proceed past a broken phase.
5. A final summary lists every stage completed, every commit made, and the recommended next steps.

> **Using the workflow engine:** at the pre-flight gate, type `GO --workflow-engine` to execute the compiled manifest through `forge-workflow-engine` instead of the prompt-driven `forge-orchestrate-build`. That path installs the execution packages and runs the native engine (default harness: OpenCode), which owns retries and durable run state.

> **Resuming after interruption:** If the run is interrupted, use
> `forge-launcher resume` to pick up the current authoring or manifest stage.
> Once the engine has started, it resumes from `docs/WORKFLOW-STATE.json` and
> the latest durable `docs/PROGRESS.md` checkpoint; authoring readiness comes
> from `docs/authoring-state.json`, not an LLM-authored execution plan.

---

## Step 2 - Build the PRD

### 2a. Generate the PRD

If you have seed documents (vision, research, architecture notes, specs), list them explicitly:

```
@workspace /forge-build-prd Build a complete PRD for this project using the following source documents:
- docs/PRD.md
- docs/research/architecture-options.md
- docs/specs/event-schema.md
- docs/specs/privacy-and-redaction.md
- docs/roadmap/mvp-plan.md
- docs/adr/001-separate-project-packaging.md

Save the output to docs/PRD.md.
```

If you are starting from scratch with just an idea:

```
@workspace /forge-build-prd I want to build [describe your idea in 2–3 sentences]. 
Interview me for requirements and then produce a full PRD saved to docs/PRD.md.
```

### 2b. Quality Pass on the PRD

After the PRD is generated, run a gap check:

```
@workspace /forge-build-prd Review the generated docs/PRD.md for gaps.
Check that every major component has: clear acceptance criteria, a defined tech stack, 
non-functional requirements (performance, security, privacy), and implementation phases. 
Flag anything missing and fill in the gaps.
```

> **Canonical authoring:** `forge-build-prd` writes PRD.md and features directly.
> There is no standalone PRD, intermediate catalogue or size threshold.

---

## Step 3 - Convert Legacy Sources When Needed

Skip conversion for newly authored canonical features. Existing source documents
must be converted before building, regardless of size. Preserve historical
originals and completed task IDs, but do not execute or maintain duplicate tasks.

### 3a. Decompose

```
@workspace /forge-decompose-prd Analyze docs/requirements-source.md and convert it into:
- A PRD document at docs/PRD.md
- Individual Feature documents in docs/features/
Ensure each feature is self-contained with its own user stories, requirements, phases, and acceptance criteria.
```

### 3b. Validate decomposition

```
@workspace /forge-decompose-prd Review the feature documents in docs/features/ and confirm:
- Every PRD requirement is covered by exactly one feature
- Feature dependencies are declared correctly
- No feature has circular dependencies
Report any gaps or issues.
```

---

## Step 4 - Generate the Agent Team

### 4a. Build the team

**From Canonical PRD and Features:**
```
@workspace /forge-build-agent-team Analyze docs/PRD.md and all feature documents in docs/features/.
Generate a complete specialist agent team (`.md` files) in .agents/agents/
that covers all features holistically without overlap or gaps. Do not create
project skill packages in this stage.
```

### 4b. Validate the team

```
@workspace /forge-build-agent-team Validate the agent team you just generated.
Confirm that every PRD requirement (or every feature in docs/features/) maps to exactly one 
primary owner agent, there are no ownership gaps, and no two agents have conflicting responsibilities.
Produce a responsibility matrix as a markdown table and save it to docs/agent-responsibility-matrix.md.
```

After generating agents, commit the team and ownership artifacts:

```bash
git add .agents/agents/ docs/
git commit -m "feat: generate specialist agent team from PRD"
```

### 4c. Generate project skills

Run the project-skill authoring stage separately after the team is reviewed.
The stage must report an explicit success, including a valid no-skills-required
outcome when appropriate; a missing or failed result is not silently treated as
an empty skills set.

The team stage writes the versioned handoff at
`docs/SKILL-CANDIDATES.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "candidates": [
    {
      "name": "project-skill-id",
      "description": "What the project skill handles",
      "consumers": ["agent-id"],
      "action": "reuse",
      "reason": "Existing skill satisfies the responsibility"
    }
  ]
}
```

The project-skill stage may choose `reuse`, `extend`, `create`, or `omit`.
`omit` preserves an existing package unless reconciliation explicitly retires
it. The stage does not create or replace the execution manifest.

From the launcher, invoke the independent stage with:

```bash
forge-launcher draft-skills --repo <path> \
  --prd-model <id|inherit> --team-model <id|inherit> --skills-model <id|inherit>
```

Use `forge-launcher authoring-config` to save or clear the versioned project
settings, and `forge-launcher authoring-models --runner copilot|opencode
--refresh` to refresh the runner inventory before choosing an explicit model.
Config writes validate schema only; live availability is checked when a stage
is invoked. The inventory is stored separately from execution-agent overrides.

---

## Step 4.5 - Assign Models per Agent (Optional but Recommended)

An unset authoring or execution model inherits the active runner default. Do not
claim a concrete default model ID unless the runner inventory reports one. The
authoring model settings use `docs/authoring-config.json` with optional `prd`,
`team`, and `skills` keys, plus `FORGE_PRD_MODEL`, `FORGE_TEAM_MODEL`, and
`FORGE_SKILLS_MODEL` stage overrides. Explicit unavailable selections must fail
clearly rather than being silently replaced.

### 4.5a. Discover available models

```
@workspace /forge-assign-models Discover what models are available in my environment
(local Ollama plus my harness subscription) and cache the inventory at
docs/research/model-inventory.json. Do not change any agent files.
```

### 4.5b. Recommend a per-agent assignment

```
@workspace /forge-assign-models Read the cached inventory and the agent team in
.agents/agents/, classify each agent's workload, and produce docs/MODEL-PLAN.md with a
proposed primary + fallback model per agent. Do not modify the agent files yet.
```

### 4.5c. Apply the recommended models

After reviewing `docs/MODEL-PLAN.md`:

```
@workspace /forge-assign-models Apply the recommended models from docs/MODEL-PLAN.md by
adding model: and modelFallback: to each agent's YAML frontmatter. Show me a diff
summary first and ask for confirmation before writing.
```

### 4.5d. Re-tune after team changes

After `forge-build-agent-team` runs in Feature Increment Mode:

```
@workspace /forge-assign-models Re-tune the model assignment for the changes introduced
by the latest feature. Only re-evaluate agents whose role changed; leave the rest alone.
Update docs/MODEL-PLAN.md.
```

---

## Step 5 - Plan and Execute the Build

### 5a. Generate an execution plan (inspect before committing to action)

```
@workspace @project-orchestrator Analyze docs/PRD.md and produce an execution plan only.
Do not implement anything yet. List each phase, the agents involved, their tasks, 
and the dependencies between phases. Save the plan to docs/PROGRESS.md.
```

**For feature-based builds:**
```
@workspace @project-orchestrator Analyze docs/PRD.md and all feature documents in docs/features/.
Build a feature dependency graph and produce an execution plan showing which features will be built 
in which order and why. Save the plan to docs/PROGRESS.md. Do not implement anything yet.
```

### 5b. Execute one phase at a time

Start with Phase 1 and review output before proceeding:

```
@workspace @project-orchestrator Execute Phase 1 only.
After completing Phase 1, stop and summarize what was built, what tests passed, 
and what the next phase will require. Update docs/PROGRESS.md.
```

Continue phase by phase:

```
@workspace @project-orchestrator Phase 1 is approved. Execute Phase 2 only.
Stop after Phase 2 and report status.
```

**For feature-based builds, execute one feature at a time:**
```
@workspace @project-orchestrator The execution plan is approved. 
Build Feature 1 (docs/features/feature-01-event-capture.md) only.
Stop after it is complete and all acceptance criteria pass. Update docs/PROGRESS.md.
```

### 5c. Resume from a checkpoint

If a session ends mid-build:

```
@workspace @project-orchestrator Read docs/PROGRESS.md to understand the current state of the build.
Resume from where we left off. What is the next uncompleted task?
```

---

## Step 6 - Add a Feature to an Existing Project

After the initial build is complete, use this workflow to add new features:

### 6a. Create a Feature PRD

```
@workspace /forge-build-feature-prd I want to add [describe the new feature] to this project.
Analyze the existing codebase and agent team, then produce a Feature PRD saved to 
docs/features/feature-XX-[name].md. Include an Agent Impact Assessment showing which 
existing agents are affected and whether any new agents are needed.
```

### 6b. Extend the agent team if needed

```
@workspace /forge-build-agent-team A new Feature PRD has been added at docs/features/feature-XX-[name].md.
Review the Agent Impact Assessment and update the agent team (`.md` files) in .agents/agents/ accordingly.
Only modify or create agents that are directly affected by this feature.
```

### 6c. Execute the feature

```
@workspace @project-orchestrator A new Feature PRD is at docs/features/feature-XX-[name].md.
Read it, build the feature execution plan, and execute Phase F1 only.
Stop after F1 and report status.
```

---

## Step 7 - Dark Orchestration / Workflow-Engine Build Path (Optional)

After the PRD and agent team are generated, you can choose to execute the build through a real model harness instead of the prompt-driven `project-orchestrator` flow. Use one execution path per run. This is "dark orchestration" - a background process that fires actual model invocations, persists state, and requires no human input between tasks.

### 7a. Compile the execution manifest

The workflow engine reads `docs/EXECUTION-MANIFEST.json`, which is produced by the `forge-execution-adapter` skill. The commands below install dependencies for the adapter before compiling:

```bash
cd .agents/skills/forge-execution-adapter
npm install
npm run forge-execution-adapter -- compile
```

Inspect the compiled manifest and review any warnings before running:

```bash
npm run forge-execution-adapter -- inspect
```

### 7b. Run the workflow engine

Choose your execution harness. The commands below install the workflow-engine dependencies and then start the engine:

```bash
cd .agents/skills/forge-workflow-engine
npm install

# OpenCode CLI (default) - requires `opencode` in $PATH
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness opencode

# OpenAI API - requires OPENAI_API_KEY env var
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness openai

# Stub / dry-run - no real calls, verifies engine setup
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness stub

# Parallel dispatch (opt-in, harness-gated) - up to 3 ready tasks at once
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness opencode --concurrency 3

```

Or, use the `workflow-orchestrator` agent for a guided interactive experience:

```
@workspace @workflow-orchestrator Run the workflow using OpenCode.
```

### 7c. Monitor and recover

```bash
# Check current run state
npm run workflow-engine -- status

# Replay a failed task after fixing the root cause
npm run workflow-engine -- replay P1-T1 --harness opencode

# Pause after the current task (then resume with `run`)
npm run workflow-engine -- pause
```

> **When to use `workflow-orchestrator` vs. `project-orchestrator`:**
>
> Use `project-orchestrator` for interactive, phase-by-phase builds with human review at each stage.
> Use `workflow-orchestrator` (backed by the workflow engine) for fully autonomous execution in CI/CD, scheduled jobs, or when you want zero interruptions after the pre-run gate.
> Both can be used on the same project - they share `docs/PROGRESS.md` as the common state.

---

## Step 8 - Optimize Existing Skills

After building a project, audit the generated skills against agentskills.io best practices:

### 8a. Audit skills

```
@workspace /forge-optimize-skills Audit all skills in .agents/skills/ against best practices.
Score each skill and produce docs/SKILL-AUDIT.md. Do not modify any files yet.
```

### 8b. Apply approved improvements

After reviewing `docs/SKILL-AUDIT.md`:

```
@workspace /forge-optimize-skills Apply the approved changes from docs/SKILL-AUDIT.md.
Only modify skills I've approved in the audit report.
```

## Tips

- **Open your target project first** - agents and skills resolve from the current workspace or repo directory.
- **Review before executing** - always run the execution plan prompt (Step 5a) before asking the orchestrator to build anything.
- **Headless runs get the same quality checks** - the headless/auto-draft PRD flow runs the Step 2b gap check (acceptance criteria, tech stack, NFRs, phases) and fills gaps before approving, and the skills' built-in validations (decomposition Step 6, team Step 7) always run - headless or not.
- **One phase at a time** - resist asking the orchestrator to "build everything". Phases are checkpoints; review each one.
- **Commit after each phase** - the orchestrator will prompt you, but make a habit of it. `git add . && git commit -m "feat: complete Phase N"`.
- **The PRD is the source of truth** - if something looks wrong, fix the PRD first, then re-run the affected steps.
- **Re-bootstrap safely** - run `forge-launcher bootstrap . --force` any time you want to pull in updated MyForge templates without losing your generated agents.
- **Optimize generated skills** - after the initial build, run `@workspace /forge-optimize-skills` to audit your skills against best practices. The audit surfaces specific improvements you can apply immediately.
- **Full auto build** - use `forge-auto-build` when a reviewed PRD already exists (`docs/PRD.md`, or the decomposed layout) and you want a single command to take you from that PRD to committed, validated code. One pre-flight gate, then fully autonomous. If no PRD exists yet, run `forge-auto-build-prd` first. If the run is interrupted, just re-invoke it -it resumes from `docs/PROGRESS.md`.
- **Dark orchestration** - use `workflow-orchestrator` + the workflow engine for fully autonomous execution through a real harness (OpenCode or OpenAI API). Dry-run first with `--harness stub` to verify the engine setup before spending tokens.
