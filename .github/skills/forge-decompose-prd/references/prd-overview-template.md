# PRD Template

Load this when writing a PRD document.

Use this structure for direct authoring or legacy conversion. Source-section
placeholders below describe where to find existing decisions during conversion;
new solutions populate them directly. Define shared rules/stories once with
`forge-requirement` blocks. Tables list IDs, canonical links and metadata instead
of repeating definition text. Feature-owned requirements and tasks stay in their
features; this vision has no executable task catalogue.
