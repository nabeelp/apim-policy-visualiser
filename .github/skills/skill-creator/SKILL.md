# Skill: Create a New Copilot Skill

You are guiding the user (or yourself) through building a new Copilot skill from scratch. The goal is not just to scaffold files - it is to produce a skill that passes the skill-review quality bar from the start. The workflow runs in five numbered steps with explicit decision points.

Load `references/quality-axes.md` now. You will use the six quality axes throughout all five steps.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Interview

Gather the information needed to build the skill well. Load `references/interview-questions.md` for the full question bank.

Ask the questions in order. Record the answers - you will use them in Steps 2–5. Do not skip questions; each one drives a specific scaffolding decision.

**Minimum required before proceeding:**
- Skill name (must match the directory name)
- One-sentence purpose
- Activation trigger phrase
- Step count and whether any branching or conditional logic exists
- Whether supporting reference material is needed

> **Calibration note:** The interview is open-ended - guide without constraining. If the user is uncertain about step count or complexity, default to modular. It is easier to collapse a modular skill than to refactor a flat one after the fact.

### Step 2: Template Selection

Based on the interview answers, choose the scaffold template:

| Signal | Template |
|--------|----------|
| ≤3 steps, no branching, no reference material | **Flat** - single `SKILL.md` |
| ≥4 steps, OR branching logic, OR supporting material | **Modular** - `SKILL.md` + `references/` |

State your choice and reasoning to the user before proceeding. Allow them to override.

Load the chosen template:
- Flat: Load `references/flat-template.md`
- Modular: Load `references/modular-template.md`

### Step 3: Scaffold

Generate the skill files using the loaded template and the interview answers. Build each section intentionally against the six quality axes (loaded in the intro).

**Section-by-section guidance:**

| Section | Quality axis | What to do |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| YAML frontmatter | - | `name` must match the directory name after YAML parsing. Emit `name: deploy-service`; never copy JSON delimiters into the value as `name: '"deploy-service"'`. `description` must include trigger keywords. |
| Opening paragraph | Context economy | State exactly what the skill does and when to use it. No generic preamble. |
| `## Process` steps | Procedural clarity | Write *how to approach* each step, not just *what to produce*. Include decision criteria. |
| `## Gotchas` | Gotchas coverage | Add at least two concrete, project-specific edge cases. Use exact pattern: `**{Failure name}.** {What goes wrong and the concrete fix.}` - never generic advice. |
| Load triggers (modular only) | Progressive disclosure | Each trigger must say *when* to load, not just *what* exists. |
| `## Validation` | Validation | Include a self-check checklist or concrete commands the agent can run. |
| Prescriptiveness level | Calibration | Fragile/destructive ops → exact commands. Variable/creative ops → defaults + escape hatches. |

After generating, check: is `SKILL.md` under 500 lines? If not, move bulk content to `references/`.

### Step 4: Pre-flight Check

Before calling `skill-review`, run a self-check against the pre-flight list.

Load `references/preflight-checklist.md` now.

Work through every item on the checklist. For each failure:
1. State what is wrong
2. Fix it immediately
3. Mark it as resolved

Do not proceed to Step 5 until all blockers are cleared.

### Step 5: Validation

Run the formal `skill-review` audit on the newly created skill.

**Check if skill-review is available:**

```bash
ls .github/skills/skill-review/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null || echo "skill-review not found"
```

If `skill-review` is not found, report the prerequisite clearly:

> ⚠️ **skill-review is required for validation.** Install it at `.github/skills/skill-review/` before running this step. The skill has been scaffolded but not formally validated.

If available, invoke it:

```
/skill-review Audit the skill at <path-to-new-skill>
```

**Validation loop:**
1. Review the audit findings
2. For each finding scored below 2: fix it in the skill files
3. Re-run the audit
4. Stop when all axes score ≥ 2.0 (or the user accepts the current state)

After passing, confirm the install path and remind the user to copy the skill to `.github/skills/<skill-name>/`.

## Gotchas

- **`name` must exactly match the directory name.** A mismatch breaks skill activation. JSON quote characters delimit an input string and are not part of the name. Emit `name: deploy-service`, not `name: '"deploy-service"'`. If parsed frontmatter contains wrapping quote characters, remove them before Step 5.
- **Load triggers must say *when*, not just *what*.** "Load `references/api-errors.md` if the API returns a non-200" is good. "See references/ for more" is useless and will score a 1 on progressive disclosure.
- **Do not move the first ~100 lines of SKILL.md to references/.** That content defines the skill's purpose and trigger conditions - it must stay inline even if it is verbose.
- **Gotchas must be concrete.** "Handle errors appropriately" scores a 1. "If the `users` table uses soft deletes, queries must include `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`" scores a 3.
- **skill-review will not run on a skill that has no SKILL.md.** Ensure the file exists and has valid YAML frontmatter before Step 5.
- **Do not skip Step 4.** The pre-flight check catches issues that skill-review will flag. Fixing them before the audit saves a loop.

## Validation

After completing the full workflow, verify:

- [ ] `<skill-name>/SKILL.md` exists with valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] `name` in frontmatter matches the directory name
- [ ] `description` contains the trigger keywords from the interview
- [ ] All six quality axes are intentionally addressed in the skill content
- [ ] SKILL.md line count is under 500: `wc -l <skill-dir>/SKILL.md` (expect `< 500 <path>`)
- [ ] YAML frontmatter parses cleanly: `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('<skill-dir>/SKILL.md').read())"` exits 0
- [ ] If modular: `references/` exists with at least one file and all load triggers are specific
- [ ] Pre-flight checklist passed with no open blockers
- [ ] `skill-review` audit completed (or prerequisite absence documented); all axes ≥ 2.0
- [ ] User has been told where to install the skill (`.github/skills/<name>/`)
