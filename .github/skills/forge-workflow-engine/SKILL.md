description: "Dynamic workflow orchestration engine that reads docs/EXECUTION-MANIFEST.json and drives every task to completion through a pluggable harness adapter (OpenCode CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude Code CLI, OpenAI API, or stub). Maintains docs/WORKFLOW-STATE.json for machine-readable run state and syncs docs/PROGRESS.md after every task. Use this skill after forge-execution-adapter has compiled the manifest."

# Skill: Forge Workflow Engine

You are the **runtime execution layer** for an MyForge repository. Where `project-orchestrator` operates as a prompt-driven orchestrator inside a chat harness, this skill runs **outside** the chat session - it reads the structured execution contract produced by `forge-execution-adapter` and drives every agent task through a real execution backend until the workflow is complete.

This skill is the autonomous execution alternative to the prompt-driven flows. Teams use it when they want **dark orchestration**: a background process that fires agent invocations autonomously, persists state across interruptions, and requires no human intervention between tasks. Start it from the terminal with `forge-launcher engine-run`, or drive it from inside a chat with `@workflow-orchestrator`.

---

## Prerequisites

Structured `forge-task` contracts require explicit output files, passing
validation commands and a final `forge-result` outcome report. Repository CLI
tasks read an engine-generated execution file containing mandatory task fields
and reference paths; supporting documents are read on demand. `human-review` tasks
pause without model dispatch: an operator must run `approve-task <id> --repo
<path> --reviewer <name> --evidence <file> --confirm-human-review`, then resume.
Agents must not invoke this command or fabricate review evidence. `--yes` never
approves human work. Legacy tasks retain opt-in command validation.

Before running this skill, the following must exist in the repository:

- `docs/EXECUTION-MANIFEST.json` - compiled by `forge-execution-adapter`
- Agent `.md` files under the harness agents directory. Load `forge-build-agent-team/references/detect-harness.md` to detect the active harness; the conventional paths are:
  - `.github/agents/` (GitHub Copilot harness)
  - `.claude/agents/` (Claude Code harness)
  - `.opencode/agents/` (OpenCode harness)
  - `.github/agents/` (generic / default fallback)
- A configured execution harness (OpenCode CLI in `$PATH`, the `claude` CLI in `$PATH`, or `OPENAI_API_KEY` set)

If the manifest does not exist yet, run the adapter first:

```bash
cd .github/skills/forge-execution-adapter
npm install
npm run forge-execution-adapter -- compile
```

---

## Install & Run

### Task execution files

For repository-tool tasks, Copilot/OpenCode receive a short single-line prompt
pointing to `docs/artifacts/<task-id>.md` (for example, `WALK-1.md`). The
engine refreshes this same file with the current attempt and retry feedback.
Read that file before
working. Follow its validated task scope, requirements, criteria, constraints,
output files and validation commands; inspect relevant reference sections as
needed. Do not reinterpret the whole PRD or implement unrelated tasks. Supporting
documents do not override the explicit task contract.

The file also carries prerequisite context, run/attempt metadata and the fallback
specialist persona. Native agents are selected with `--agent`. Do not edit or
commit execution files or treat their creation as task work. They are retained
local diagnostics, with a path/digest logged by the engine, not authenticated
evidence. Delete them only after active invocations finish and diagnostics are
no longer needed. The engine excludes them from work attribution and auto-commit;
pre-staged execution files must be manually unstaged before an auto-commit can
proceed. An attached OpenCode server must see the same repository filesystem.

Text-only requests retain inline context and the OpenAI API path is unchanged.
Do not use large inline text requests through a CLI with argument-length limits.
Human review still pauses without creating a model execution file.

Load [`references/engine-entry.md`](references/engine-entry.md) when you need
the complete command matrix or headless entry-point guidance.

```bash
cd .github/skills/forge-workflow-engine
npm install
```

### Start or resume a full run

```bash
npm run workflow-engine -- run
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness opencode
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness claude
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness openai
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness stub          # dry-run, no real calls
npm run workflow-engine -- run --max-retries 3 --retry-delay-ms 10000
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness opencode --yes   # skip the pre-run gate
npm run workflow-engine -- run --heartbeat-ms 5000        # heartbeat every 5s while a task runs
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness opencode --keep-alive   # warm opencode server for the run
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness stub --viz --yes # run with the live Forge Board dashboard
```

The engine prints a pre-run summary (harness, phases, tasks) and, when run
interactively, pauses for confirmation before dispatching. The gate is
interactive-only: pass `--yes` (or set `FORGE_ENGINE_YES=1`) to skip it
explicitly for headless/CI runs, and it auto-skips when stdin is not a TTY.

### Heartbeat

While a task is executing (e.g. a long `opencode run` / `copilot -p` call), the
engine prints a `…still working on task <id> (@<agent>, Ns elapsed)` line at a
fixed interval so a quiet terminal doesn't look hung:

```bash
npm run workflow-engine -- run --heartbeat-ms 60000        # default: 60s
npm run workflow-engine -- run --heartbeat-ms 0            # disable
```

`--heartbeat-ms` overrides the `FORGE_ENGINE_HEARTBEAT_MS` environment variable.

### Keep-alive attach mode (opencode harness)

Cold-starting a fresh `opencode run` for every task re-boots the project
instance each time: config, AGENTS.md, skills, agent files, and every MCP server
(the biggest chunk of per-task overhead). To avoid that, the engine keeps a
single headless `opencode serve` warm and attaches every task to it.

**By default the engine is adaptive:** when more than one task remains, it boots
one `opencode serve` for the run and attaches every task to it; when a single
task remains (e.g. a short resume), it cold-starts that one task instead so it
does not pay the server boot cost. This applies to the `opencode` harness only.

You can override the default:

```bash
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness opencode                 # adaptive (default)
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness opencode --keep-alive    # force keep-alive
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness opencode --no-keep-alive # force cold start per task
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness opencode --keep-alive --keep-alive-port 4096
```

The owned server is torn down when the run finishes, startup fails, or startup
is cancelled. Windows cleanup terminates the server PID tree (including command
wrappers); POSIX cleanup signals an owned process group and escalates to SIGKILL
after one second. Cleanup fails explicitly after five seconds instead of waiting
indefinitely for inherited stderr pipes to close. Repeated shutdown calls share
one result. Externally supplied `--attach` servers are never stopped by the engine.

Each `opencode run --attach` still
creates a fresh, isolated session per task - the server only keeps the shared
project instance (config/skills/MCP) warm. If you already keep an `opencode serve`
running (e.g. started manually or by the TUI), skip the lifecycle management and
point tasks at it:

```bash
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness opencode --attach http://127.0.0.1:4096
```

`--keep-alive`, `--no-keep-alive`, and `--attach` also have env equivalents:
`FORGE_ENGINE_ATTACH=1` (force keep-alive), `FORGE_ENGINE_ATTACH=0` (force cold
start), and `FORGE_ENGINE_ATTACH_URL=<url>` (reuse an existing server).

### Live visualization (The Forge Board)

Pass `--viz` (or `--viz=<port>`, default `4299`) to run to launch a live PixiJS
dashboard of the build in your browser. The build renders as a kanban board:
one band per phase, with tasks as name-tag cards (each carrying the owning
agent's face and name) flowing left-to-right through To Do / In Progress /
Done / Failed, connected by dependency and artifact edges. Hover for tooltips,
click a card to expand it in place with task detail (description, status,
owner, phase, duration, artifact, inputs, dependencies, outputs, validation,
errors), drag to pan, scroll to zoom.

```bash
npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness stub --viz --yes
npm run workflow-engine -- run --viz=5000 --no-open   # fixed port, no browser auto-open
```

Attach to an already-running or detached engine run from any terminal:

```bash
npm run workflow-engine -- viz --repo <repo-dir>
```

The dashboard is loopback-only and streams events over SSE. See ADR-025.

### Task timeout

Each task runs against the harness with a per-task timeout. If the harness call
does not finish in time, the child process is killed and the task counts as
failed (subject to `--max-retries`). The default is **10 minutes**.

Process transport results use `status: null` when the runner initiates timeout,
cancellation, or output-overflow termination, regardless of cleanup callback
order. The failure reason and classification remain available; normal process
exits retain their actual exit codes.

```bash
npm run workflow-engine -- run --task-timeout-ms 1500000       # 25 minutes
FORGE_ENGINE_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS=1500000 npm run workflow-engine -- run
```

Precedence: a task's `timeoutMs` field in the manifest (if present) overrides
the engine-wide value. Hand-edit `docs/EXECUTION-MANIFEST.json` to give one
heavy task a longer budget:

```json
{
  "id": "1.2",
  "title": "Migrate the monolith",
  "timeoutMs": 3600000
}
```

The pre-run summary prints the effective timeout. Adapters that shell out
(`opencode`, `copilot`, `claude`, `openai`, `stub`) enforce it on the child process; the
`openai` adapter enforces it on the API call via `AbortController`.

### Output verification gate (strict by default)

A harness call that exits 0 is **not** proof that a task did anything — a model
can reply "Ready for the task." and produce no files. The engine therefore
verifies a successful call before marking the task complete:

- **Expected outputs.** If a task declares `expectedOutputs`, every one must
  exist after the harness call. Missing outputs → the attempt is treated as
  failed, retried up to `--max-retries`, then marked `failed` with the missing
  list as the error.
- **No-op detection.** Tasks that declare no `expectedOutputs` must show evidence
  of work: file changes in the git working tree (diffed before/after the call,
  engine-owned `docs/` files excluded) **or** a substantive agent response. A
  task with no changes and only trivial output ("Ready for the task.") is a
  failed attempt, not a completion.
- **Relax it** with `--allow-noop` / `FORGE_ENGINE_ALLOW_NOOP=1` to skip the
  no-op heuristic (the expected-output check stays).
- **Structured reports.** Tasks with a contract must return a fenced `forge-result`
  JSON object with only two required fields: `summary` and `unresolved`. Use
  `{"summary":"Actual outcome and required checks verified.","unresolved":[]}`
  inside the fence. Summary can be a nonempty string or list of strings.
  `decisions`, `interfaces`, `tests`, `warnings` and `validationLimitations` are
  optional string arrays; omit empty or redundant detail. The report is limited
  to 16000 characters. `unresolved` contains only blocking unmet requirements
  or acceptance criteria and must be empty to complete. An unverified required
  check remains a blocker. Optional string arrays `warnings` and
  `validationLimitations` retain nonblocking observations and non-required checks
  not run; the engine lists limitations under `## Validation Gaps` in
  `docs/PROGRESS.md` and the Console shows them to dependent human reviewers.
  Leaving changes for engine auto-commit is not a blocker. Never relabel
  an unmet required check as a warning to bypass completion.
- **Validation commands.** Structured tasks always run their manifest commands
  after the output and report gates pass. For legacy tasks, pass `--run-validation` /
  `FORGE_ENGINE_RUN_VALIDATION=1` to execute each task's manifest
  `validationCommands` (cwd = repo root) and require them all to exit 0 before
  the task counts as complete. Tasks that declare validation are gated on it
  rather than the no-op heuristic. Without the flag, legacy commands are only
  shown in the task prompt. Reported tests are not a substitute for engine checks.

The pre-run summary prints the gate mode. The final summary and `status` also
flag tasks completed with no recorded output files, so a hollow run is visible.

### Harness invocation and activity logging

Every CLI harness invocation is logged before launch - and again when Windows
launcher resolution rewrites it - with the timestamp, harness, run ID, task ID,
attempt, working directory, executable, and the complete argument list
(JSON-escaped per argument, so paths with spaces and multiline prompts stay
unambiguous; execution files are named, never expanded). Recognized credentials
are replaced with `[REDACTED]`; environment variables are never dumped.

Activity logging is **off by default**. Enable `--log-harness-activity` /
`FORGE_ENGINE_LOG_HARNESS_ACTIVITY=1` (or the Console **Log harness activity**
toggle) to stream harness stdout/stderr into `docs/engine-run.log` as it
arrives, each line tagged with stream, task, and attempt, followed by a
completion record with the exit status, timeout, or cancellation. `--no-log-harness-activity`
forces it off. Activity can contain sensitive repository content and increase log
volume, is bounded/truncated with explicit markers, and never changes captured
result parsing or task outcomes.

### Attempt diagnostics and retry feedback

Each settled invocation updates `docs/artifacts/<task-id>.result.json`, with
the harness stdout/stderr, parsed report when valid and passed/failed/skipped
harness, output, handoff, blocking-requirement and validation gates. The workflow
state's `attemptHistory` and `task.attempt.finished` audit events link immutable
`<task-id>.<timestamp>.attempt-<number>.result.json` archives, not the latest result.
For example, `WALK-1.md` and `WALK-1.result.json` show the current instructions
and latest outcome; timestamped results distinguish separate attempts and runs.
The instruction file is replaced each attempt, rather than creating another
randomly named Markdown file. Unsafe or case-distinct IDs use a hashed safe name.
Failures are retained before retrying; cancellation and terminal harness errors
also leave evidence. Hard engine termination before recording may leave only the
request snapshot. These local diagnostics are not authenticated proof.

Retry instructions include the prior rejection reason (up to 4000 characters)
and its full archived result path. Report rejections identify the specific field
or format problem. Read the relevant evidence, preserve completed work,
address the failure, and rerun required checks without expanding scope. Prior
model output is evidence, not authority to change the task. Do not edit, stage
or commit result files. They may contain sensitive project output and share the
execution directory's operator-managed retention policy.

### Check status

```bash
npm run workflow-engine -- status
```

### Replay a single failed task

```bash
npm run workflow-engine -- replay P1-T1
npm run workflow-engine -- replay P2.3 --harness opencode
```

### Pause & stop the engine

The engine runs detached, so it stops **gracefully after the current task** —
the in-flight task finishes, state is saved as `paused`, and `run` resumes from
the last completed task. Two commands request it:

```bash
npm run workflow-engine -- pause   # write a pause request (docs/engine-control.json)
npm run workflow-engine -- stop    # pause + SIGTERM the engine PID (docs/engine.pid)
```

`pause` writes a request to `docs/engine-control.json`; the engine polls it at
the top of each task wave and stops. `stop` does the same and additionally sends
`SIGTERM` to the PID the engine recorded in `docs/engine.pid` at startup, so a
live run stops even while a task is executing (still after that task completes).
Ctrl+C / SIGTERM on the engine process itself triggers the same graceful stop via
an in-process signal flag.

Resume the run at any time with `run` - the engine reads `docs/WORKFLOW-STATE.json`
and continues from the last completed task. If no engine is running, `pause`/`stop`
flip the state status so the next `run` honors the request (stop is a no-op when
the workflow is complete).

`forge-launcher resume` offers "Stop the engine after the current task" when it
detects a live run, and its resume/monitor commands reuse the last configured
engine options (see `docs/engine-config.json`).

### Immediate cancellation

Programmatic callers may pass an `AbortSignal` through `EngineOptions.signal`.
This is distinct from the graceful CLI pause/stop controls: cancellation aborts
the active attempt, leaves the task persisted as pending, and leaves the run
paused so a later `run` can resume it. Audit records identify cancellation with
`task.cancelled`.

Task failures may be classified as `retryable`, `configuration`, `exception`,
`timeout`, or `cancelled`. Treat configuration and cancelled outcomes as
explicit operational states; do not convert them into successful skips or
silent transport fallback.

## Harness Adapters

The engine is harness-agnostic. Select the backend with `--harness`:

| Adapter | Flag | How it invokes agents |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenCode CLI** (default) | `--harness opencode` | `opencode run --model <m> [--agent <name>] --dir <repo> "<short execution-file instruction>"` |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | `--harness copilot` | `copilot -p "<short execution-file instruction>" [--agent <name>] --yolo` |
| **Claude Code CLI** | `--harness claude` | `claude -p "<short execution-file instruction>" --output-format json [--agent <name>] --permission-mode bypassPermissions` |
| **OpenAI API** | `--harness openai` | `POST /v1/chat/completions` with agent rawBody as system prompt |
| **Stub** | `--harness stub` | Returns synthetic success; no real calls (for testing) |

### OpenCode adapter environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENCODE_BIN` | `opencode` | Path to the opencode binary |
| `OPENCODE_EXTRA_FLAGS` | *(empty)* | Extra flags appended to every `opencode run` call |
| `FORGE_ENGINE_ATTACH` | *(empty)* | `1` to force the `opencode serve` keep-alive for the run (`--keep-alive`); `0` to force cold start per task (`--no-keep-alive`); unset = adaptive (keep-alive when >1 task remains) |
| `FORGE_ENGINE_ATTACH_URL` | *(empty)* | Attach tasks to an existing `opencode serve` URL instead of cold-starting per task (`--attach`) |
| `FORGE_ENGINE_NATIVE_AGENT` | *(empty)* | `0` to force the inline-persona fallback instead of `--agent <name>` for `.opencode/` agents |

### Claude Code adapter environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_BIN` | `claude` | Path to the Claude Code CLI binary |
| `CLAUDE_EXTRA_FLAGS` | *(empty)* | Extra flags appended to every `claude -p` call (e.g. `--model opus`) |

`--permission-mode bypassPermissions` is always passed so tool calls are
auto-approved in a non-interactive run, and the `--output-format json` result
envelope is parsed to classify failures as `configuration` or `retryable`.

### Copilot adapter environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `COPILOT_BIN` | `copilot` | Path to the GitHub Copilot CLI binary |
| `COPILOT_EXTRA_FLAGS` | *(empty)* | Extra flags appended to every `copilot -p` call (e.g. `--model gpt-4o`) |

The copilot adapter selects the forge agent **natively** when its file lives
under the project's `.github/agents/` directory: it passes `--agent <name>` so
the Copilot CLI loads the persona itself. Use a CLI version supporting this flag;
`FORGE_ENGINE_NATIVE_AGENT=0` provides a fallback for older installations.
For other harness roots (`.agents`, `.claude`, `.opencode`), the persona is
included in the repository task's execution file. Tool permissions are auto-approved
with `--yolo`, mirroring the opencode adapter's `--auto`.

The opencode adapter selects the forge agent natively when its file lives under
the project's `.opencode/agents/` directory: it passes `--agent <name>` so
opencode loads the persona itself (sessions show the forge agent, not the
default build agent) and does **not** inline it. For other harness roots
(`.agents`, `.claude`, `.github`) opencode cannot discover the agent files, so it
includes the fallback persona (`agent.rawBody`) in the repository execution file.
Tool permissions are auto-approved with `--auto` in both cases.

The claude adapter selects the forge agent natively when its file lives under
the project's `.claude/agents/` directory: it passes `--agent <name>` so the
Claude Code CLI loads the persona itself. It is the only transport that is
native on the forge's canonical Claude root. For other harness roots
(`.agents`, `.github`, `.opencode`) the CLI cannot discover the agent files, so
the adapter includes the persona in the repository task's execution file instead.
The successful envelope's `result` text passes through the engine's structured
report, output and validation gates, with the same attempt archives and retry
feedback as Copilot and OpenCode. Text-only tasks retain inline prompts.

Set **`FORGE_ENGINE_NATIVE_AGENT=0`** on any of these harnesses to force the
persona fallback instead of native agent selection (`--agent`). For repository
tasks the fallback is in the execution file; for text-only tasks it is inline.

### Task capability and request contract

The engine prepares one read-only `TaskAttemptRequest` per attempt and passes it
to the selected adapter. It contains the task, agent, effective model,
projected context, repository, attempt metadata, and execution budget; mutable
workflow state is never passed to an adapter.

Manifest tasks may declare:

```json
{
  "requiredCapabilities": ["text"]
}
```

Use `["text"]` for tasks that do not need repository tools and
`["repository-tools"]` for tasks that edit or inspect the repository. A missing
or empty declaration is conservatively treated as `["repository-tools"]` for
legacy manifests. OpenAI is text-only and rejects repository-tool tasks before
dispatch; there is no silent execution fallback.

Model precedence is `task.model`, then agent model, then the transport default.
Adapters expose readonly capabilities and optional run-scoped `prepare` and
`cleanup` hooks; cleanup runs even when an attempt, replay, or server startup
fails.

### OpenAI adapter environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | *(required)* | API key |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | Override for compatible APIs |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | `gpt-4o` | Default model (overridden by agent `model:` frontmatter) |

### Stub adapter environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `STUB_FAIL_TASK_IDS` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated task IDs to fail synthetically |
| `STUB_DELAY_MS` | `0` | Simulated latency per task in milliseconds |

---

## Output Files

Bootstrap ignores `docs/artifacts/`; the engine excludes its generated records
from task attribution and auto-commit, including already tracked files. Pre-staged
records block auto-commit without altering the user's index. Existing
`docs/task-executions/` records and links are preserved and retain these exclusions.
Updating templates does not untrack, relocate or remove existing diagnostics.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docs/WORKFLOW-STATE.json` | Machine-readable run state - task statuses, retries, outputs, blockers |
| `docs/PROGRESS.md` | Human-readable progress (synced after every task, compatible with `forge-orchestrate-build` format) |
| `docs/EXECUTION-AUDIT.jsonl` | Append-only audit trail for every state transition |

---

## State Model

`docs/WORKFLOW-STATE.json` structure:

```json
{
  "runId": "uuid",
  "startedAt": "ISO-timestamp",
  "lastUpdatedAt": "ISO-timestamp",
  "manifestPath": "docs/EXECUTION-MANIFEST.json",
  "manifestVersion": "1.0",
  "harness": "opencode",
  "status": "running | paused | complete | failed",
  "currentPhase": "1",
  "tasks": {
    "1.1": {
      "taskId": "1.1",
      "status": "complete | running | pending | failed | skipped",
      "ownerAgent": "api-engineer",
      "startedAt": "ISO-timestamp",
      "completedAt": "ISO-timestamp",
      "attempt": 1,
      "outputFiles": ["src/api/routes.ts"],
      "agentOutput": "..."
    }
  },
  "blockers": [],
  "auditLog": []
}
```

---

## DAG Execution Order

The engine builds a live task graph from `EXECUTION-MANIFEST.json`:

1. Phases execute in dependency order (Phase 2 only starts after all Phase 1 tasks are complete or skipped).
2. Within a phase, tasks with resolved dependencies run first.
3. Tasks with no unresolved dependencies within a ready phase run immediately (sequential for safety in MVP mode).
4. A task whose `ownerAgent` cannot be matched to a discovered `.md` agent file is **skipped** with a warning rather than failing the run. Skipped tasks satisfy dependencies (they are treated as done), so a skipped task never blocks a downstream phase.

---

## Retry Logic

Each task is retried up to `--max-retries` times (default: 2) before being marked failed.

- Delay between retries defaults to 5 000 ms (`--retry-delay-ms`).
- A failed task blocks all downstream tasks in the same phase.
- Use `npm run workflow-engine -- replay <task-id>` to re-run a single failed task after fixing the root cause.

---

## Resume Behaviour

- `run` is idempotent: if `docs/WORKFLOW-STATE.json` already exists, the engine continues from the last non-complete task.
- Tasks marked `complete` or `skipped` are never re-executed.
- If the run was `paused`, `run` resumes it.
- If the run was `failed`, `run` resumes by re-trying tasks that are not yet complete (use `replay` to target a specific task).

---

## Integration with forge-launcher (terminal-driven build path)

The launcher is the canonical terminal entry point. Its auto-draft stages run
`forge-build-agent-team` headlessly and then offer to start the engine detached;
`forge-launcher engine-run` compiles the manifest and runs/resumes the engine as
a foreground or detached process:

```bash
forge-launcher engine-run --repo <repo> --harness opencode --yes        # run or resume
forge-launcher engine-run --repo <repo> --harness opencode --yes --viz  # with the Forge Board
forge-launcher resume --repo <repo>                                      # re-enter at the current stage
```

This gives the same project two mutually exclusive execution modes for a given run: interactive/prompt-driven (via `@project-orchestrator` in a chat harness) or autonomous/harness-driven (via this engine, from the terminal or `@workflow-orchestrator`).

---

## Gotchas

- **Manifest must exist first.** The engine reads `docs/EXECUTION-MANIFEST.json` - it does not re-parse the PRD. If the PRD changes after a compile, re-run `forge-execution-adapter compile` and then start a fresh run.
- **State is tied to a run ID.** Compiling a new manifest after a partial run will produce a manifest that no longer matches the in-progress state. Start a new run (`rm docs/WORKFLOW-STATE.json`) rather than mixing them.
- **OpenCode must be in `$PATH`.** The `opencode` adapter shells out to the binary. If OpenCode is installed at a non-standard path, set `OPENCODE_BIN`.
- **Per-task cold start is the main harness overhead.** Every fresh `opencode run` re-boots config, skills, and all MCP servers. The engine now defaults to adaptive keep-alive (warm `opencode serve` when >1 task remains) to avoid this; pass `--no-keep-alive` to force cold starts.
- **Attach mode needs a healthy server.** Keep-alive (forced or adaptive) polls `GET /global/health` before dispatching and fails fast if `opencode serve` cannot start. Reusing `--attach` against a dead URL fails per task - start the server first.
- **Agent file paths must be absolute or resolvable from the repo root.** Discovery reads the agent `.md` file and sets `agent.path`. Native adapters pass `--agent <name>`; other roots use the persona in the execution file for repository tasks, or inline for text-only tasks.
- **Parallelism is opt-in and harness-gated.** The engine executes the ready-task frontier concurrently up to `--concurrency <n>` (default `1` = sequential). Only harness adapters that declare `supportsConcurrency` are parallelized; **same-owner tasks are always serialized** (at most one task per agent per wave), and repo-editing harnesses still rely on the dependency graph for file isolation. Cross-owner tasks on shared paths remain the operator's responsibility. See ADR-021.

---

## Artifact Pattern

The engine implements the **Task → Agent → Artifact → Task** pattern described in the MyForge research. Instead of passing the full workflow state or previous agent output to each agent, the engine:

1. Resolves which artifact types the next task declares as `inputs`
2. Loads only those artifacts from `docs/artifacts/`
3. Projects a compact summary (the fields the agent actually needs)
4. Prepends the projection block to the agent's prompt

This is the primary mechanism for **context-window efficiency** — especially useful with small local models.

### Declaring artifact contracts in the manifest

`forge-execution-adapter compile` **auto-declares** `produces` (and `inputs`)
for every task it emits, so the artifact layer is on by default — no hand-editing
required:

```json
{
  "id": "1.2",
  "produces": "work.1.2",
  "inputs": ["work.1.1"]
}
```

- **`inputs`** — list of artifact type strings the engine will load and project before running this task. The compiler wires each task to the previous task's `produces` (the linear dependency chain).
- **`produces`** — the artifact type the engine records for this task. If the agent does not write one explicitly, the engine synthesises a minimal one from the task's outputs.

You can still hand-edit `docs/EXECUTION-MANIFEST.json` to use semantic types
(e.g. `solution.architecture`, `implementation.result`, `test.result`) or to
declare cross-task `inputs` beyond the linear chain — the compiler's defaults are
just the starting point.

### Artifact storage layout

```
docs/artifacts/
  architecture/
    architecture-001.json
  implementation/
    implementation-001.json
    implementation-002.json
  review/
    review-001.json
```

Each artifact is a small JSON document with a `summary` field, an optional `payload`, and metadata (`taskId`, `producedBy`, `inputs`, `filesChanged`, `nextActions`).

### Audit events

Two new events appear in `docs/EXECUTION-AUDIT.jsonl`:

```jsonc
// Emitted once per projected context (before task starts)
{
  "event": "context.projected",
  "taskId": "review-api",
  "sourceTokenEstimate": 12480,
  "projectedTokenEstimate": 2180,
  "reductionPercent": 82.5
}

// Emitted once per artifact created (after task completes)
{
  "event": "artifact.created",
  "taskId": "implement-api",
  "artifactId": "implementation-001",
  "artifactType": "implementation.result",
  "inputArtifacts": ["architecture-001"]
}
```

The `reductionPercent` field is the quantitative proof-of-value: it records how much context was *not* sent to the agent.

### Skipping the artifact pattern

Tasks without `inputs` or `produces` are unaffected. The artifact layer is strictly additive — an existing hand-written manifest that omits them continues to work unchanged (the engine simply skips artifact creation and projection for those tasks).

## Validation

Before reporting a run complete:

- [ ] `docs/WORKFLOW-STATE.json` exists and `status` is `"complete"`
- [ ] All tasks in the manifest are `"complete"` or `"skipped"` in the state file
- [ ] `docs/PROGRESS.md` reflects the completed state
- [ ] `docs/EXECUTION-AUDIT.jsonl` contains a `run.complete` event
- [ ] No tasks have `status: "failed"` (if any do, the run status will be `"failed"`, not `"complete"`)
- [ ] For each task with `produces`, a corresponding artifact file exists in `docs/artifacts/`
